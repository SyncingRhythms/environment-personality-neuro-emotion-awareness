# Family Threat and Emotional Awareness: The Indirect Link via Resting-State Network Connectivity within Negative Urgency Context

Using multi-level data (survey and fMRI) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study (N=9876), we formed latent constructs for family threat (Time 1), negative urgency (Time 1), and emotional awareness (Time 7; 3 years later).

Motivation, theory, and results are summarized in the abstract found within (threat_negUrg_rsfc_aware.pdf; accepted to 2024 conference meeting of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology).
